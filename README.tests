If tests are failing there are couple of things you might want to check.

Firstly, make sure ZSYS_INTERFACE or BEACON_INTERFACE environment variables
are not set. They might set to incorrect value.

Secondly, make sure the hostname of the machine is accessible, for instance
if the hostname is set to "devel" then it has to be resolvable to correct ip
address (e.g. 127.0.0.1), otherwise test nodes won't be able to connect to the
remote nodes (which in fact for testing purposes most likely the are in local
machine).

For testing with docker you need to set BEACON_INTERFACE to the correct
interface (e.g. docker0).
